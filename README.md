# GTD
My personal Artificial Intelligence project, operating based on modern machine learning techniques.  I am currently planning out this project, with ideas to connect my IoT devices together, have the ability to issue commands, and make daily tasks more efficient.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Examples
```
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
Say what the step will be
```
Give the example
```
And repeat
```
until finished
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why
```
Give an example
```
### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why
```
Give an example
```
